adequate form for the Robotics team to emulate their
outlook towards others and themselves. The reasoning
behind the team "Uniform" T-Shirts is to distinguish
ourselves at competition and have a notable presence
in the community during outreach events. It matters
that the team members are all similar and equal on
the team, which the t-shirts reflect. However
denotation is important for prevalent roles on the
team, and chevron's procure that individuality while
staying uniform to the team.

a solid baseline for the T-Shirt design, and the
