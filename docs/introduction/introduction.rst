Why we have a Uniform and Style Guide
=====================================

The Uniform and Style Guide outlines the design as well
as the expectation carried with our team uniforms. 
Tidal Force designs and wears our uniforms to distinguish
ourselves at competition and have a notable presence
in the community during outreach events. It matters
that the team members are all similar and equal on
the team, which the t-shirts reflect. However
denotation is important for prevalent roles on the
team, patches and chevron's procure that individuality
while staying uniform to the team.

How to use the Uniform and Style Guide manual
=============================================

This this manual is just a simple guide, each 
year changes to the uniforms are expected and 
encourage by the new team leadership.
Amendment towards the teams logos, apparel,
ect. is encouraged and is part of how our team
has grown in the past, however this guide lays out
a solid baseline for the T-Shirt design, and the
chevron patterns.

Responsibility of uniform and style Guide
=========================================

This uniform and style guide in par with the
Operation manuel's rules on Team Apparel (7.10) and
Logo Changing Process (7.9) clearly define the
amending and change of the team uniforms in the
responsibility of the Captain and the Board. Chevron
design and stylized patches also fall towards the
captain and boards approval.

.. A short history section would be nice here.
