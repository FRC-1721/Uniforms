   outreach, team events and anything else. They are always a student.

   The Assistant-Captain is the second highest position on the team, it is not 
   necessarily filled every year. The co-captain directly leads the team
   along with the Captain, and serves in their absence with all the command associated.
   The assistant captain is always a student.
